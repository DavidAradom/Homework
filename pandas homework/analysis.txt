Of the 1163 active players, the vast majority are male (84%) which expectantly correlates with a higher total purchase value but the average purchase price across all genders were very similar ranging from $3.02 - $3.46. I would expect males to be willing to spend more, but the pricing across all items could be similar. The next step would be to look at the range of prices and/or average purchase pricing for a deeper analysis. 
There is a noticeably big gap between the top three highest age demographics (20-24, 15-19, and 25-29). The top three age groups out of a total of seven groups accounts for more than 75 percent of all players.
