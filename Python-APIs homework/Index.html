  <h1>Python-APIs Homework</h1>
  <p>
      WeatherPy

        In this example, you'll be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, you'll be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.
        
        Your objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
        
        
        Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
        <img src = "temp_plot.png" alt="Portrait">
        Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
        <img src = "humidity_plot.png" alt="Portrait">
        Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
        <img src = "cloudiness_plot.png" alt="Portrait">
        Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
        <img src = "wind_speed_plot.png" alt="Portrait">
        
        
        Your final notebook must:
        
        
        Randomly select at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
        Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
        Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
        Save both a CSV of all data retrieved and png images for each scatter plot.
        
        
        As final considerations:
        
        
        You must complete your analysis using a Jupyter notebook.
        You must use the Matplotlib or Pandas plotting libraries.
        You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
        You must use proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles (with date of analysis) and Axes Labels.
        See Example Solution for a reference on expected format.
